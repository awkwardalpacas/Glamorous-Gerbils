There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## NomNow2.0 ##
<!--  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand. -->

## Discover wait times at restaurants before you go ##
<!--  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title. -->

## NomNow2.0 gives you a map of nearby eateries with a quick indication of wait-times, to help you decide where to go. When you have a limited time to eat, use NomNow2.0 to discover and avoid the line when you can't wait. ##
<!--  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good. -->

## The scenario : You have a busy day, full of meetings and work. You have an hour for lunch. You take 15 minutes to get to your favorite sandwich shop, only to find a line out the door! That's a quarter of your lunch hour gone, and now you have to pick someplace else. With NomNow2.0 you would have known about the line beforehand, and picked someplace with a shorter wait. ##
<!--  > Describe the problem your product solves. -->

## NomNow2.0 gives a simple map view to show eateries nearby with a quick indicator of wait times, and an easy way to report those wait times.  ##
<!--  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem. -->

## Your time is valuable, use NomNow2.0 to select the shortest lines when you are in a hurry ##
<!--  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company. -->

## Just go to (URL TBD) with your computer or device and click or touch a location on the map to see reported wait times. ##
<!--  > Describe how easy it is to get started. -->

## Jay Random, a busy dude : 'NomNow2.0 saved me from waiting most of my lunch hour for a burrito at the Burrito Hut. I saw the wait was too long that day at a glance and had a sandwich from Sandwich Planet instead, where there was a much shorter line. It was awesome!' ##
<!--  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit. -->

## Skip the lines, not the lunch ##
<!--  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next. -->
